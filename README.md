INSTRUCTIONS

Build a new React Application called MyBooks. 
Run Through and follow the setup with create-react-app
You'll build an application that has Bookshelves and Books within those bookshelves. 
Each book should have the data points of:
Title
Author
Year
Genre
Create custom style for the application
Check for type on any data you are passing. 

Each member will need to create a feature branch to work on a different part of the app and merge into the master when it is completed



Add the ability for the user to add a book (i.e. no hardcoding books!). 
 

EXTRA CHALLENGE: Refactor your application to operate more as a library. I.e. Many bookshelves, with many books. 
You could also let the user add bookshelves.


Some people have bookshelves of books they've never read. So try adding some functionality that allows the user to denote whether or not they've read the book. 


Create a button within each book that user's can hit to denote they've read the book. 
The button should change color and text. 
I.e. Going from Something like:

Unread

To:

Read


Create some routes for your bookshelf application such as
a button that renders another component. This should be able to apply to every book.
